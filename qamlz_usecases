Use Cases
- Researcher using different pruning
- Researcher wanting to build binary classifier for other events (HEP not necessarily Higgs)
    - Potentially useful for binary classification outside of HEP
- Porting qamlz to a different quantum hardware

Jobs/Responsibilities
- Abstracting away from D-Wave (ease of use)
- Binary classification model
- Safety/Runability checks on user jobs??

NOT Jobs
- Users job to separate train and test dataset
- Deep analysis and comparisons of results

Nouns
- Input datasets -> scikit-learn representation
- model
- quantum machine -> turn into independent functions
- results (train accuracy, test accuracy, performance statistic) -> scikit-learn representation

Actions
- dataset preprocessing
- problem pruning
- error correction
- dwave annealing
- model postprocessing

What I Do
- Simplify model training and annealing
    - split large/complex functions into smaller chunks
